Use `simple-baseline.ipynb` and `libfewshot-baseline.ipynb` 

to run the baseline models.

The implementations are adapted from the implementation of the original papers found [here](https://github.com/corwinliu9669/embarrassingly-simple-baseline) and [here](https://github.com/RL-VIG/LibFewShot). Note due to the size limit, the pretrained model for baselines are not included but they can be downloaded from the following links:

- [Simple Baseline](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10EG8o9AH7gnG2VtP2Y7R0wzVBH8Wboi5/view?usp=sharing) (random pruning is added only during testing time)
- [LibFewShot Baseline]()
